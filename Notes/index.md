# Operating Systems in Three Easy Pieces!!!

## Virtualization:
- Virtualizing the the concept of a process and representing it as a PCB. This allows the OS to schedule these processes
  in a better fashion allowing for multi-programming and timesharing
- Virtualizing the memory, thus allowing for Transparency, Safety, Efficiency especially in multiprogramming and time    sharing system!!

## Concurrency:
A whole bunch of theory about threads, locks, semaphores, monitors. This project won't implement threads, only single threaded processes

## Persistence:
Yes, this
