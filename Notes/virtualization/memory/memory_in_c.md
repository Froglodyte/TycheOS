# Managing memory is incredible important

The standard C library provides two functions, `malloc` and `free`, which are of essential to manage heap based memory

The stack is implicitly managed by the compiler, hence called automatic memory.

The heap is managed by you the programmer, atleast in C! (higher level languages have automatic garbage collection)
